# Keebtrack
This is a personal project that I want to do. This project consists of creating a tracker that counts total keystrokes but also individual keystrokes. The reason I am creating this is because I want to see how long how my mechanical keyboards last.

I also dont know how to code so this will take a lot longer than orignally planned.
