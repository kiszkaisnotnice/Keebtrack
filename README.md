# Keebtrack
This is a personal project that I want to do. This project consists of creating a tracker that counts total keystrokes but also individual keystrokes. The reason I am creating this is because I want to see how long how my mechanical keyboards last.

I also dont know how to code so this will take a lot longer than orignally planned.

# Goals

This is a layout of what I want to accomplish with this project (WIP)
- Create a overall keycounter (for example: 100000 presses)
- Indivdual key press (for example: A - 100 presses, B - 2000 presses)
- Switch database (for example: Kailh Box Jades, Cherry Mx Red, etc)
- Wear percentage (for example: A - 100000 presses, Kailh Box Jades rated @ 80000000 clicks, wear percentage 0.1%)
- Multiple Keyboard options
- Being able to log in on multiple computers
- Online data base
- Clean and simple look like monkeytype
